## About  
I am currently working full-time as a **Project Research Assistant** with the **eSim team at FOSSEE, Indian Institute of Technology Bombay**. My work primarily focuses on the **development of open-source EDA tools** for circuit design, simulation, and education.  

Previously, I was a **Research Trainee at the Space Applications Centre, ISRO Ahmedabad**, where I worked with **RTG4 space-grade FPGAs** in the Satellite Communication Division.  

My expertise includes:  
- Power Electronics and Motor Drives  
- Embedded Systems & FPGA Programming  
- Circuit Simulation & Control Systems  
- Hardware-Software Integration
